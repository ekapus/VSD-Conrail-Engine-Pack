# VSD-Conrail-Engine-Pack

Virtual Sound Decoders are JMRI functionality that allows modelers to simulate a sound decoder for a locomotive through their computer.

I think it's a fascinating technology and I started playing around with it, creating a set of VSD definitions for some common locomotives that Conrail owned. 

The files are, instead of being locomotive specific, represent combinations of prime mover and horn, since those are the major sound generators in a locomotive. 

In my VSDs I have the following definitions:
- EMD 16-645E NA (Roots Blown/non-turbo) w Leslie RS-3L (Common Conrail 3 Chime) Horn (GP38s/GP38-2s)
- EMD 16-567C NA (Roots Blown/non-turbo) w Wabco E2 (Single Chime Road Unit Horn) Horn (GP7/GP9/GP8/GP10/GP11)
- EMD 16-567C NA (Roots Blown/non-turbo) w Leslie RS-3L (Common Conrail 3 Chime) Horn (GP7/GP9/GP8/GP10/GP11)
- GE 7FDL w Leslie RS-3L (Common Conrail 3 Chime) Horn

This repository is my source for those definitions, shared so other modelers can try them out.
